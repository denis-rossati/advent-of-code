# What is this?

A repository where I'll solve all the puzzles from (advent of code)[https://adventofcode.com/].

## How are you gonna make it?

through studies, persistence and PHP. With unit tests and etc.

Wish me luck!

The file schema will be like

`[year]->[day]->[src] and [tests] and README.md`

Each day will have a README with the problem description and a brief (or not) explanation about my thought line.
