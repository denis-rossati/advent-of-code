# What is this?

A repository where I'll solve all the puzzles from [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## How are you gonna make it?

With hope.

Wish me luck!

The file schema will be like

`year->day->code`

Each day will have a README with the problem description and a brief (or not) explanation about my thought line.
